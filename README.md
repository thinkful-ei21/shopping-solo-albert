Implement the following features which will require a more complex STORE object:

- User can press a switch/checkbox to toggle between displaying all items or displaying only items that are unchecked

- User can type in a search term and the displayed list will be filtered by item names only containing that search term

- User can edit the title of an item

- You must use the state management pattern. Update the store; run the render function. Do not directly update the DOM.
